# closedCurves


## Minimal canonical representation of closed curves bounding contiguously classed regions in pixelated space.


### To make run

`make`

this creates two executables `closed_curves` and `closed_curves_parallel`


### To demo run

`./closed_curves demo`

or

`./closed_curves_parallel demo`


### To use run 

`./closed_curves <PARAMS>`

or

`./closed_curves_parallel <PARAMS>`


where `<PARAMS>` is of the form of the `debug_data` within the `debug_data.h`. AKA an unorderd list of ordered (COLORTYPE COORDINATE) pairs.

Not audited, but WELL used. Still, use at your own risk.
